# Project Benchmark code

These suite of code are working for build plots and make fitting. There is also an error anlaysis function to perform root mean square error analysis about fitting result. The code is written in Python and we apply some major modules for our work, namely numpy, scipy, matplotlib.plt and pandas.

This work is done by Jianyue Wang(Student number 20046304) as a part of UCL individual project: Characterise Exscale Testbed.

## Data 

The data file in this project is the timeing data by running MILC code on Skylake and Icelake system along with Armforge profiling tools.

To use the module for later works, data should follow some particular format. Which could be seen in the sample csv files. First, the data file should follow a csv format. Then, it would the best if the heading of the data follow this pattern: x label,MPI Time,Memory time,CPU time,Total Time,x. 

## Documentation

There are documentation files unerder ./docs folder that contains detailed information about function usage, input, output, parameters and limitation. One major file is located in ./docs/_build/content/benchmark-docs.html . Which is generated by the Sphnix auto module.
